# 🚀 QUICK DEPLOYMENT FIX

## The Problem
- Render free tier has 512MB memory limit
- Whisper "base" model (139MB) + PyTorch = Out of Memory
- Solution: Use "tiny" model (39MB) + optimized settings

## ✅ What I Fixed
1. **Whisper Model**: Changed from "base" to "tiny" (39MB vs 139MB)
2. **Gunicorn Settings**: Added memory management flags
3. **Torch Version**: Downgraded to 2.0.1 for better compatibility
4. **Build Commands**: Optimized for Render free tier

## 🔧 Deploy Steps
1. **Push to GitHub** (I'll do this now)
2. **On Render Dashboard**:
   - Go to `minute-mate-whisper` service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" → "Clear build cache & deploy"
3. **Wait for build** (should succeed now)
4. **Test**: Visit `https://minute-mate-whisper.onrender.com/health`

## 📝 What Changed
- `whisper_api.py`: Default model = "tiny"
- `render.yaml`: Optimized gunicorn settings
- `requirements.txt`: Compatible torch version

## 🎯 Expected Result
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Service starts without OOM
- ✅ Tiny model loads (39MB)
- ✅ API responds to requests

The tiny model is still very accurate for most use cases!
